# Settings Guide
## Bindings
You can either create **button combination** bindings (buttons pressed at the same time), or **button sequence** bindings (buttons pressed in a sequence).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Button sequence bindings must contain exactly 2 buttons!

## Chats
![](./images/chat_binding_example.png)

Customize the chat, the chat mode, and how it will be triggered.

### Word Variations
![](./images/variation_list_example.png)

Create your own word variation lists in the `Word Variations` tab. Choose a name for the list, then add words in the `variations` section. Each word must be separated by a new line (hence the long text box)

When you're done editing, click `Save`

Then use `[[variation list name]]` syntax in your chats to include your word variations.

**For example:** A chat set up as `hello [[friend]]` will evaluate to: `hello homie` or `hello my guy` etc. based on whatever words/phrases are put in the `friend` variation list.

 - Word variation lists must be at least 3 words long (preferrably 4+)

 - Word variations are chosen randomly from the list by default, so it's always a surprise ðŸ˜Š


## Special Effects
Similar to variations, you can include these keywords in your chat to trigger special functionality:

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure to have `Show player MMR on scoreboard` and `Show MMR in casual playlists` enabled in the bakkesmod `Ranked` tab for blast ranks functionality to work

>[!TIP]
>Don't name your word variation lists the same as these

`[[lastChat sarcasm]]`      | returns the last chat iN sArCAsM tExT
`[[lastChat uwu]]`          | returns the last chat in UÏ‰U text â‰½^â€¢â©Šâ€¢^â‰¼ ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ ( Ë¶Ë†ê’³Ë†Ëµ )
`[[speechToText]]`          | start listening for speech-to-text, then send the result in chat
`[[speechToText sarcasm]]`  | start listening for speech-to-text, then send the result in chat (with sarcasm effect)
`[[speechToText uwu]]`      | start listening for speech-to-text, then send the result in chat (with UÏ‰U effect)

<br>

**Example:** `"[[lastChat]]" - toxic nerd` will wrap the last chatter's chat in quotes and look like it came from a toxic nerd

## Speech-to-text
The `[[speechToText]]` keyword uses whatever mic is set as your default input device in Windows sound settings:

![](./images/default_device.png)

**To change the default mic:** select it in the list, then click the `Set Default` button

If you have multiple mics connected, make sure the one you're using in RL is the default device. If you continuously get a `No speech detected` error, try disabling all other active mics from the list.

### Troubleshooting speech-to-text errors:
The plugin uses a websocket connection to handle speech-to-text tasks. A python script is ran in the background which acts as the server, and the plugin simply sends a request to the server for every speech-to-text task... Then the result is sent back to the plugin (aka the client).

If an error occurs on the server (the python process) it should be logged in the `ErrorLog.txt` file located here:
```
bakkesmod\data\CustomQuickchat\SpeechToText\ErrorLog.txt
```

If an error occurs on the client (the plugin), it should be logged in the `F6` console window.
